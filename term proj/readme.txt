Project Name: Pixelshop
Description: Pixelshop is a simple application that allows users to upload and 
            edit photos, users can add interesting built-in filters and adjust 
            image properties. Users can zoom in and out the image and change 
            image position to better gauge the effects. They can also draw on 
            the image by picking a color and erase the lines.
            The methods are built by looping over the pixels and changing the 
            relevant values, thus it is called 'Pixelshop'.
